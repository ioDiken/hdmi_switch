# HDMI Switch

This repo implements a smart HDMI switch for the Arty Z7 SoC. It has added support for the [Black Mesa Labs HDMI Pmod](https://blackmesalabs.wordpress.com/2017/12/15/bml-hdmi-video-for-fpgas-over-pmod/) as support for an additional HDMI Source. The HDMI Source provided on the Arty Z7 was modified to be an HDMI Sink so that the board could support two inputs and a single output. Current features are simple - an HDMI splitter.

[Here is the demo of the project](https://youtu.be/r2BTD2Vx8H0)! It was a fun project, and hopefully we will continue it in our free time :)
